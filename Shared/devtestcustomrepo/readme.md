This is a custom repo for use with the DevCamp. Current artifacts include
* windows-chocolatey-devcamp: this is a short fork from the official repo at (https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/Artifacts/windows-chocolatey) to allow for the passing of custom command line arguments, such as ignore-checksum that we need to get past chocolatey-versioning issues. These changes will be submitted back to the public repo, at which point this fork can be deprecated
