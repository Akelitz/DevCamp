# City Power & Light - NodeJS Version

## Overview
This directory implements the CP&L demonstration in pure server side NodeJS. 

The project began using yeoman's [generator-express](https://github.com/petecoop/generator-express) to scaffold out the project files.  

>Note that the Jade library, traditionally used for rendering views in Express, has been renamed.  This project has swapped out Jade for the properly named [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
